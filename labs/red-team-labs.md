# Red Team Labs

## Overview
Red team labs simulate offensive security scenarios. The goal is to understand attacker techniques and improve defense.

## Sample Labs
1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Footprinting and information gathering.
   - Identify open ports and services.

2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
   - Network scanning with Nmap.
   - Service enumeration and version detection.

3. **Exploitation**
   - Exploit known vulnerabilities in systems.
   - Practice SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflow.

4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Privilege escalation.
   - Maintaining access and covering tracks.

## Notes
- Always perform these labs in isolated environments.
- Do not attack real systems without permission.
